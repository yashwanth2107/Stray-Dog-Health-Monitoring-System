# Stray-Dog-Health-Monitoring-System
 This is project for protecting abandoned, and stray dogs. People can ask for a help if they see a stray dog with minor/major injuries and send the location through the website, which connects it to the nearest NGO/BlueCross 
 and if the injury is minor they come to the location with the required kit and medicate the dogs. And if injury is major, they take the dog to the hospital with the help of volunteers.
